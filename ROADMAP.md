# Roadmap for File Verification System Refactoring and Improvement

## Introduction

This roadmap outlines the steps for refactoring and improving the File Verification System to align with Accredify coding standards, enhance security, and ensure scalability. The goal is to create a modular and easily maintainable system that can be utilized by others in the future.

## Phase 1: Code Refactoring and Standards Alignment

- [ ] Perform a comprehensive code review to identify areas that need refactoring.
- [ ] Update the codebase to adhere to Accredify coding standards and best practices.
- [ ] Implement consistent naming conventions, indentation, and documentation.
- [ ] Refactor complex or redundant code to improve readability and maintainability.

## Phase 2: Modularization for File Verification

- [ ] Analyze the file verification process to identify distinct steps or components.
- [ ] Break down the file verification process into modular components (e.g., file upload, hashing, signature verification, result generation).
- [ ] Implement each module as separate components with well-defined interfaces.
- [ ] Create clear and concise documentation for each module, including usage instructions and input/output specifications.

## Phase 3: Scalability and Performance Optimization

- [ ] Identify potential bottlenecks or performance issues in the current system.
- [ ] Optimize database queries and indexing to improve data retrieval speed.
- [ ] Implement caching mechanisms for frequently verified files to reduce processing overhead.
- [ ] Explore horizontal scaling options, such as sharding or partitioning, to accommodate increased load.

## Phase 4: Testing and Quality Assurance

- [ ] Design and implement a robust testing strategy, including unit tests, integration tests, and security testing.
- [ ] Conduct thorough testing of each module and the overall system to ensure functionality, security, and scalability.
- [ ] Perform load testing to assess the system's performance under different levels of load and traffic.

## Conclusion

By following this roadmap, we aim to transform the File Verification System into a secure, scalable, and modular solution that adheres to Accredify coding standards. These improvements will not only enhance the system's current capabilities but also make it more accessible and usable by others in the future.
